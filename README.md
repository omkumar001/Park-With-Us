# Park-With-Us
It is a project made in my First Year for the **HACKIIITV'19** which was a intra-institute hackathon . With this idea my team was able to get in top 6 among the 30+ participating teams. It was basically a Parking Lot Booking System where:

- The user can book his parking slot very easily and smoothly .
- It is being made to overcome the crowd .
- Save time and avoid the towing of vehicle for violating the parking rules.


The slot booking has been given the same UI as that of seat selection of the Book My Show App. and the Google Map will be used for the locating the available parking slots and seeing the user's current location .
Only the frontend of this project was being made during that time . The Database and the Backend is still to be done .
